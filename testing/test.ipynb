      "“Ole-le, Ola-la, ser del Barça és el millor que hi ha,” I chant in the Olympic Stadium, despite my lack of fluency in Catalan. The November air is cold — well, cold for Spain. Bright lights pick out smiles in the crowd and the sweat of the players. A rising tide of excitement and unity swallows me as I watch the Barcelona community around me.\n",
      "\n",
      "To my left, a sea of Lamine Yamal jerseys; to my right, two men embrace after the first goal; in front of me, nothing but blue, red, and yellow. I find it hard not to cry — not out of sadness, but because the scene is so beautiful and overwhelming that words fail me. It wasn’t just my friends celebrating, it was _us_ — the FC Barcelona fans in a single, breathing community.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What was this feeling? Why was I so emotional?” I ask myself. My best friend looked at me with tears in her eyes and the answer I’d learned years before comes back to me: Émile Durkheim’s Collective Effervescence.\n",

      "\n",
      "Collective Effervescence is a state of [“intense shared emotional activation and sense of unison that emerges during instances of collective behavior.”](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9473704/) This idea came from a 1912 book by Émile Durkheim called _The Elementary Forms of Religious Life_. This state of being presents itself in situations where people come together to share an experience and strong emotions. Instead of focusing on individual energy and being, there is a shared sense of belonging and unity. Concerts, sports matches, vigils, protests, and religious ceremonies are common sites of this phenomenon — moments when people suspend individual self-interest and tap into something larger.\n",
      "\n",
      "The feelings left behind after singing lyrics in unison, watching strangers embrace at a social justice march, holding vigil for a loss, or cheering at a graduation are all forms of collective effervescence. While these moments often bring joy and connection, they can also involve solemn or painful emotions: shared silence, grief, and compassion are equally powerful. At their core, these experiences are not about pure positivity; they are about shared emotion, solidarity, and community.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well… so what? Why is this important while abroad? What does this have to do with cultural differences as an American in Spain and how does it impact integration into a different culture?\n",
      "\n",
      "While collective effervescence is a temporary feeling, the effects last much longer. Since experiencing the passion of the Barca fans, I feel as if I understand the culture on an emotional level. It’s hard to respect and empathize fully with cultures that you do not understand. Putting yourself in a situation that shows raw emotion and unity can and will completely alter how you view a group of people or culture. Hearing and seeing the chanting and singing, embracing, and pride at the game gave me insight into Catalan fans, history, and belonging in a way that a textbook couldn’t provide.\n",

      "\n",
      "Beyond cultural appreciation, these moments prompt personal growth. I wasn’t just attending a game; I stepped outside myself and saw the world through a different lens. The crowd’s atmosphere gave me a new perspective and, for a while, erased my sense of being an outsider. I grasped how central FC Barcelona is to Catalan identity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet collective effervescence also brought negative aftereffects. The “loss of connection” hit me hard when the match ended. In the throes of shared emotion, you feel part of something larger than yourself; when it stops, you return to everyday life and sometimes mourn the absence of that unity. I choose to feel lucky rather than upset — lucky I experienced something so beautiful that I miss it so much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Collective effervescence is often overlooked when deep diving into the psychological theories someone can experience while abroad. We tend to focus more on the negative experiences, such as feeling isolated, out of place, and culture-shocked. However, the temporary moments that provide us with these overwhelming feelings can truly impact us for a lifetime. Once immersing yourself in these experiences, you may feel a reduction in loneliness and an increase in your resilience. [It is found that these moments provide emotional release and healing. Some emotions are hard to process on your own — but being surrounded by others can provide a safe space for emotional cleansing.](https://insights.made-in-china.com/The-Real-Reason-You-Cry-at-Concerts_UfITzkuxFJDe.html)\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot express it enough how much I believe each and every person should experience collective effervescence if and when they are abroad anywhere in the world, exposed to new cultures, or simply a part of an emotional, connected moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "My personal advice:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Participate, don’t observe.** In essence, collective effervescence is about immersing yourself in an emotional experience. Whatever the situation is, join in. The more you interact with others around you, the more connected you will feel.\n",
      "2. **Embrace the traditions.** As humans, we tend to have a hard time being a part of things that we aren’t used to. We’re so focused on perfection that we don’t try unfamiliar things. However, experiencing collective effervescence while abroad relies on your willingness to take part in local rituals and cultural events. Forget self-consciousness and worrying about looking like a tourist, being open to and participating in the event allows you to share the emotions of the crowd.\n",
      "3. **Take time to reflect.** After an event that fosters the feeling of collective effervescence, a lot of people feel very emotional. Reflect on that experience. What did it show you about human connection? Do you have a new/deeper understanding of the culture you’re in? This takes your experience and turns it into intercultural growth.\n",
      "4. **Don’t shy away from the negative emotions.** The empathy, sadness, and grief can seem overwhelming but are just as important as the other emotions. Acknowledge how you feel, share it with others, and turn this sadness into empathy and growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "> “The world is a projection of our collective consciousness. If our collective consciousness reaches that place of peace, harmony, laughter and love, it will be a different world.” — Deepak Chopra\n",
      "\n",
      "Take advantage of community-based, celebratory events. A simple 90 minute match, 2 hour concert, or political or social march can completely alter your mindset. Collective effervescence isn’t limited to my personal experience or ones similar to it. These emotional turn points are available all around us — if we take the time to look for and enjoy them.\n",

       "\n",
       "To understand our approach to improving the ML and AI development experience, it helps to consider how these workflows differ from traditional software engineering.\n",
       "\n",
       "ML and AI development revolves not just around code but also around data and models, which are large, mutable, and computationally expensive to process. Iteration cycles can involve long-running data transformations, model training, and stochastic processes that yield slightly different results from run to run. These characteristics make fast, stateful iteration a critical part of productive development.\n",
       "\n",
       "This is where notebooks — such as Jupyter, [Observable](https://observablehq.com/documentation/notebooks/), or [Marimo](https://marimo.io/) — shine. Their ability to preserve state in memory allows developers to load a dataset once and iteratively explore, transform, and visualize it without reloading or recomputing from scratch. This persistent, interactive environment turns what would otherwise be a slow, rigid loop into a fluid, exploratory workflow — perfectly suited to the needs of ML and AI practitioners.\n",
       "\n",
       "Because ML and AI development is computationally intensive, stochastic, and data- and model-centric, tools that optimize iteration speed must treat state management as a first-class design concern. Any system aiming to improve the development experience in this domain must therefore enable quick, incremental experimentation without losing continuity between iterations.\n",
       "\n",
       "## New: rapid, iterative development with spin\n",
       "\n",
       "At first glance, Metaflow code looks like a workflow — similar to [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) — but there’s another way to look at it: each Metaflow `@step` serves as [a checkpoint boundary](https://docs.metaflow.org/metaflow/basics#what-should-be-a-step). At the end of every step, Metaflow automatically persists all instance variables as _artifacts_, allowing the execution to [resume](https://docs.metaflow.org/metaflow/debugging#how-to-use-the-resume-command) seamlessly from that point onward. The below animation shows this behavior in action:\n",
       "\n",
       "Press enter or click to view image in full size\n",
       "\n",
       "![An animated GIF showing how resume can be used in Metaflow. The GIF shows how using `flow.py resume join` makes Metaflow clone previously executed steps and resumes the computation from the `join` step and continues executing till the end of the flow.](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*AEDpnt-YULYV4mcyrwLk7g.gif)\n",
       "\n",
       "Using resume in Metaflow\n",
       "\n",
       "In a sense, we can consider a `@step` similar to a notebook cell: it is the smallest unit of execution that updates state upon completion. It does have a few differences that address the issues with notebook cells:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **The execution order is explicit and deterministic:** no surprises due to out-of-order cell execution;\n",
       "- **The state is not hidden:** state is explicitly stored as `self.` variables as shared state, which can be [discovered and inspected](https://docs.metaflow.org/metaflow/client);\n",
       "- **The state is versioned and persisted** making results more reproducible.\n",
       "\n",
       "While **Metaflow**’s `resume` feature can approximate the incremental and iterative development approach of notebooks, it restarts execution from the selected step onward, introducing more latency between iterations. In contrast, a **notebook** allows near-instant feedback by letting users tweak and rerun individual cells while seamlessly reusing data from earlier cells held in memory.\n",
       "\n",
       "The new `spin` command in Metaflow 2.19 addresses this gap. Similar to executing a single notebook cell, it quickly executes a single Metaflow `@step` — with all the state carried over from the parent step. As a result, users can develop and debug Metaflow steps as easily as a cell in a notebook.\n",
       "\n",
       "The effect becomes clear when considering the three complementary execution modes — `run`, `resume`, and `spin` — side by side, mapping them to the corresponding notebook behavior:\n",

       "\n",
       "Run, Resume and Spin “modes”\n",
       "\n",
       "Another major difference isn’t just what gets executed, but what gets recorded. Both `run` and `resume` create a full, versioned run with complete metadata and artifacts, while `spin` skips tracking altogether. It’s built for fast, throw-away iterations during development.\n",
       "\n",
       "The one-minute clip below illustrates a typical iterative development workflow that alternates between `run` and `spin`. In this example, we are building a flow that reads a dataset from a Parquet file and trains a separate model for each product category, focusing on computer-related categories.\n",
       "\n",
       "Developing with spin in Metaflow\n",
       "\n",
       "As shown in the video, we start by creating a flow from scratch and running a minimal version of it to persist test artifacts — in this case, a Parquet dataset. From there, we can use `spin` to iterate on one step at a time, incrementally building out the flow, for example, by adding the parallel training steps demonstrated in the clip.\n",
       "\n",
       "Once the flow has been iterated on locally, it can be seamlessly deployed to production orchestrators like Maestro or [Argo](https://docs.metaflow.org/production/scheduling-metaflow-flows/scheduling-with-argo-workflows), and [scaled up](https://docs.metaflow.org/scaling/remote-tasks/requesting-resources) on compute platforms such as AWS Batch, Titus, Kubernetes and more. Thus, the experience is as smooth as developing in a notebook, but the outcome is a production-ready, scalable workflow, implemented as an idiomatic Python project!\n",
       "\n",
       "## Spin up smooth development in VSCode/Cursor\n",
       "\n",
       "Instead of typing `run` and `spin` manually in the terminal, we can bind them to keyboard shortcuts. For example, [the simple metaflow-dev VS Code extension](https://github.com/outerbounds/metaflow-dev-vscode) (works with Cursor as well) maps `Ctrl+Opt+R` to `run` and `Ctrl+Opt+S` to `spin`. Just hack away, hit `Ctrl+Opt+S`, and the extension will save your file and `spin` the step you are currently editing.\n",
       "\n",
       "One area where `spin` truly shines is in creating mini-dashboards and reports with [Metaflow Cards](https://docs.metaflow.org/metaflow/visualizing-results). Visualization is another strong point of notebooks but the combination of `spin` and cards makes Metaflow a very compelling alternative for developing real-time and post-execution visualizations. Developing cards is inherently iterative and visual (much like building web pages) where you want to tweak code and see the results instantly. This workflow is readily available with the combination of VSCode/Cursor, which includes a built-in web-view, [the local card viewer](https://docs.metaflow.org/metaflow/visualizing-results/effortless-task-inspection-with-default-cards#using-local-card-viewer), and `spin`.\n",
       "\n",
       "To see the trio of tools — along with the VS Code extension — in action, in this short clip we add observability to the train step that we built in the earlier example:\n",
       "\n",
       "Using Metaflow spin to iterate on card visualizations\n",
       "\n",
       "A major benefit of Metaflow Cards is that we don’t need to deploy any extra services, data streams, and databases for observability. Just develop visual outputs as above, deploy the flow, and wehave a complete system in production with reporting and visualizations included.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Spin to the next level: injecting inputs, inspecting outputs\n",
       "\n",
       "Spin does more than just run code — it also lets us take full control of a spun `@step`’s inputs and outputs, enabling a range of advanced patterns.\n",
       "\n",
       "In contrast to notebooks, we can `spin` any arbitrary `@step` in a flow using state from any past run, making it easy to test functions with different inputs. For example, if we have multiple models produced by separate runs, we could `spin` an inference step, supplying a different model run each time.\n",
       "\n",
       "We can also override artifact values or inject arbitrary Python objects — similar to a notebook cell — for `spin`. Simply specify a Python module with an `ARTIFACTS` dictionary:\n",
       "\n",
       "```\n",
       "ARTIFACTS = {\n",
       "  \"model\": \"kmeans\",\n",
       "  \"k\": 15\n",
       "}\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "and point `spin` at the module:\n",
       "\n",
       "```\n",
       "spin train --artifacts-module artifacts.py\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "By default `spin` doesn’t persist artifacts, but we can easily change this by adding `--persist`. Even in this case, artifacts are not persisted in the usual Metaflow datastore but to a directory-specific location which you can easily clean up after testing. We can access the results with [the Client API](https://docs.metaflow.org/metaflow/client) as usual — just specify the directory you want to inspect with `inspect_spin`:\n",
       "\n",
       "```\n",
       "from metaflow import inspect_spin\n",
       "\n",
       "inspect_spin(\".\")\n",
       "Flow(\"TrainingFlow\").latest_run[\"train\"].task[\"model\"].data\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "Being able to inspect and modify a step’s inputs and outputs on the fly unlocks a powerful use case: **unit testing individual steps**. We can use `spin` programmatically through [the Runner API](https://docs.metaflow.org/metaflow/managing-flows/runner) and assert the results:\n",
       "\n",
       "```\n",
       "from metaflow import Runner\n",
       "\n",
       "with Runner(\"flow.py\").spin(\"train\", persist=True) as spin:\n",
       "  assert spin.task[\"model\"].data == \"kmeans\"\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "## Making AI agents `spin`\n",
       "\n",
       "In addition to speeding up development for humans, `spin` turns out to be surprisingly handy for coding agents too. There are two major advantages to teaching AI how to `spin`:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **It accelerates the development loop**. Agents don’t naturally understand what’s slow, or why speed matters, so they need to be nudged to favor faster tools over slower ones.\n",
       "2. **It helps surface errors faster** and contextualizes them to a specific piece of code, increasing the chance that the agent is able to fix errors by itself.\n",
       "\n",
       "Metaflow users are already [using](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) Claude Code; `spin` makes this even easier. In the example below, we added the following section in a `CLAUDE.md`file:\n",
       "\n",
       "````\n",
       "## Developing Metaflow code\n",
       "Follow this incremental development workflow that ensures quick iterations\n",
       "and correct results. You must create a flow incrementally, step by step\n",
       "following this process:\n",
       "1. Create a flow skeleton with empty `@step`s.\n",
       "2. Add a data loading step.\n",
       "3. `run` the flow.\n",
       "4. Populate the next step and use `spin` to test it with the correct inputs.\n",
       "5. `run` the flow to record outputs from the new step.\n",
       "5. Iterate on (4–5) until all steps have been implemented and work correctly.\n",
       "6. `run` the whole flow to ensure final correctness.\n",
       "\n",
       "To test a flow, run the flow as follows\n",
       "```\n",
       "python flow.py - environment=pypi run\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "Do this once before running `spin`.\n",
       "As you are building the flow, you `spin` to test steps quickly.\n",
       "For instance\n",
       "```\n",
       "python flow.py - environment=pypi spin train\n",
       "```\n",
       "````\n",
       "\n",
       "Just based on these quick instructions, the agent is able to use `spin` effectively. Take a look at the following inspirational example that one-shots Claude to create a flow, along the lines of our earlier examples, which trains a classifier to predict product categories:\n",
       "\n",
       "Claude can spin too\n",
       "\n",
       "In the video, we can see Claude using `spin` around the 45-second mark to test a `preprocess` step. The step initially fails due to a classic data science pitfall: during testing, Claude samples only a small subset of data, causing some classes to be underrepresented. The first `spin` surfaces the issue, which Claude then fixes by switching to stratified sampling — and finally does another `spin` to confirm the fix, before proceeding to complete the task.\n",
       "\n",
       "## The inner loop of end-to-end ML/AI\n",
       "\n",
       "To circle back to where we started, our motivation for adding `spin` — and for creating Metaflow in the first place — is to accelerate development cycles so we can deliver more joy to our subscribers, faster. Ultimately, we believe there’s no single magic feature that makes this possible. It takes all parts of an ML/AI platform working together coherently — `spin` included.\n",
       "\n",
       "From this perspective, it’s useful to place `spin` in the context of other Metaflow features. It’s designed for the innermost loop of model and business-logic development, with the added benefit of supporting unit testing during deployment, as shown in the overall blueprint of the Metaflow toolchain below.\n",

Following our ethos of composability, all of these features integrate seamlessly with `spin` as well.\n",
